# Mortgage Calculator

This is a simple mortgage calculator originally inspired by the Zillow Mortgage calculator.  

While doing some research on mortgages I found myself looking at the JavaScript source of the Zillow Mortgage Calculator http://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/

When I discovered they weren't doing anything sophisticated I decided to build my own command line calculator.

No guarantees are made about the this code.  Use at your own peril.
